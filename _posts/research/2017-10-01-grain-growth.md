title: Grain Growth using Monte Carlo Methods

During my intern at [IISc, Bangalore][IIsc], I explored the Monte Carlo method to model grain growth. Specifically the model that is being simulated is called the Q-states potts model. 

The exact formulation that has been followed would be posted here in the near future.

The model is coded in Javascript. The calculation is performed in real time in the browser you wish to open the link that is given below. The interactiveness of the simulations allows one to dynamically change few parameters and observe its effect on the simulation. The code is available [here][ggm_repo].

For the simulation visit this [link][ggb_sim].
