title: Grain Growth using Monte Carlo Methods
categories: projects
permalink: research/grain-growth

During my intern at [IISc, Bangalore][IIsc], I explored  Monte Carlo methods to model grain growth. The Monte Carlo method is known for its reduced complexity interms of computation. 

The exact formulation that has been followed would be posted here in the near future.

The model is coded in Javascript. Coding in Javascript provided me with several flexibilities. The aim of the project was to develop a model that can be exhibited in a web browser. The interactive inputs of the simulations allows one to dynamically change few parameters and see its effect on the simulation. The code is available [link][ggm_repo].
