The two dimensional ising model is one the simplest model that can be developed using the basic principles of statistical mechanics. It describes the interaction between two spins (say up spin and down spin) based on parameters such as the temperature that is prevailing, the hamiltonian which describes the energy between two unlike interfaces.

The numerical implementation of this model makes use of the [Metropolois algorithm][metro]. Javascript is used to code the algorithm. A graphing tool is used to measure the average energy of the system. A temperature slider is coded in so that the temperature could be changed dynamically.
