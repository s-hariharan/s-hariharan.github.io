Phase field modeling is a technique that is extensively used to model microstructural evolution for various materials phenomena. As in every computational method, they are parameters that needs to be fed in as input. In the case of pure melt solidification, few of the input parameters are the interfacial energy that determines the interfaical thickness, the strength of noise that acts as thermal fluctuation and the latent heat that determines the rate at which heat can be removed from the liquid.

These parameters are generally based on a model alloy system. In this study, we are exploring a possible method to couple data from thermodynamic databases like Thermocalc to phase field models to predict microstructural evolution of a real alloy system.

Data such as driven force for phase transformation would be extracted from the database. More information would be updated as work progresses.
