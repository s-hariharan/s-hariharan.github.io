Precipitation is an important metallurgical process which is used to strengthen alloys. Most technical alloys being of Ternary systems, the study we are doing right now concentrates on how precipitation proceeds in these alloys..


We are considering a model ternary system, where two components say B and C are completely miscible. There exists an asymettric miscibility gap between AB and AC.


Through a multicomponent phase field model, we intend to simulate the precipitation phenomena and document the trends followed in terms of Volume fraction of the precipitate phase.

The phase diagram shown above is a ternary system that exhibits a two phase equilibria. The phase boundary in the diagram is generated by solving the equilibrium conditions that are needed to be satisfied by the chemical potentials of individual phases.

As this project is a work in progress, further observations will be documented in the future.
