I am a final year undergraduate student studying in National Institute of Technology, Trichy. I was brought up in Hosur, India where I completed my higher secondary education.

The idea of describing events happening through mathematics always fascinated me. Fortunately I was able to find the field of Computational Material Science, where mathematical modeling and digital experiments that are run in computers leads to better understanding of materials.

I am seeking a PhD position to start in fall 2018.
