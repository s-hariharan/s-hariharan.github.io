# Hello, This is Hariharan.
*Welcome to my webspace*



I am final year undergraduate student studying [Metallurgical and Materials Engineering][mme] at [National Institute of Technology][NITT], Trichy, India.

I am interested in the inter disciplinary field of **Computational Material Science**. Compuational Engineering as described [here][comp] is relatively a new field of Engineering where mathematical models are coupled with high performance computing to solve complex physical problem. I specifically work on microstructural evolution using various techniques like [Phase field Models][Phase] and [Monte Carlo techniques][Monte].

Aeromodeling is another activity I spend my time in. I am part of [The Third Dimension Aeromodeling Club][3d.amc] at my campus. We work on design, structural analysis, automation and fabrication of fixed wing aircrafts and multirotors.

This would serve as my personal website where I document my research and other intersting activity I am part of. Please feel free to browse your way through the website.
